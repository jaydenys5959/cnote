# cnote
## created by Abby
Hi!
I made this for my students. The main purpose of pynote is providing step-by-step python tutorial that anyone can follow and learn. If you are starting C/C++, I encourage you to run 'lab' files and work on problems in 'sol' files.
# What's in this project
- 'lab': class materials
- 'soultion': basic problems and solutions in python 

### Have fun coding!
